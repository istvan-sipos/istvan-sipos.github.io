            I'm a coder and data engineer, who finds the most joy in software with clean architecture and beautifully crafted code.

            Since 2010, I did automated reporting and data analysis, application development, and desktop automation (Microsoft Office and SAP) for E.On Customer Services Hungary using JavaScript, VBA, and C#. I also implemented end-to-end business process automation solutions using .NET and Blue Prism, occasionally wearing the hat of a business analyst.

            As a freelance consultant, right now I am looking for opportunities to utilize my skills in the following areas and technologies: machine learning, data analysis and Python programming.
